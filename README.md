<h1>Project Datamining</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<span>This project aims to forecast rainfall and temperature in Australia using a comprehensive weather dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various meteorological attributes collected over several years.</span>

<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>1. Data Preprocessing:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Handling Missing Data:</b> Apply methods such as imputation to handle missing values.</li>
<li><b>Balancing the Dataset:</b> Use the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method to address class imbalance issues in the data.</li>
<li><b>Data Visualization:</b> Visualize the data to understand its characteristics, distribution, and any underlying patterns. Provide assessments and comments on these observations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Predicting Rainfall:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Model Application:</b> Implement various machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict the likelihood of rainfall.</li>
  <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b> Compare and evaluate the models based on their accuracy and performance metrics. Identify the most optimal model for predicting rainfall.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Forecasting Temperature:</h3>
<span>ARIMA/SARIMA Models: Apply ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast the maximum temperature for each day.</span>
